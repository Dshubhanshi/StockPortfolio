# StockPortfolio

This code snippet consists of Python classes that enable users to manage a stock portfolio and retrieve real-time stock data using the Alpha Vantage API. The PortfolioDB class facilitates interaction with an SQLite database for storing stock portfolio information. It allows users to add, remove, and retrieve stocks from the portfolio. The StockAPI class interacts with the Alpha Vantage API to fetch the current stock price for a given symbol. Users need to provide their Alpha Vantage API key to access the API. The example usage section demonstrates how to use these classes to manage a stock portfolio. It initializes a PortfolioDB instance with a SQLite database file and a StockAPI instance with the user's Alpha Vantage API key. Stocks can be added to or removed from the portfolio using the add_stock and remove_stock methods, respectively. The current portfolio can be obtained using the get_portfolio method, and the current stock prices are retrieved using the get_stock_price method. This code snippet provides a simple yet powerful foundation for building a stock portfolio tracker application in Python.
